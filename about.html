                    I'm a software developer at WuXi AppTec in St. Paul, Minnesota. I work mostly with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, C#, and SQL. There is one website I get requests to work on and it involves using PHP. I'm fairly new to PHP, but am interested in learning more. Education wise, I have a Bachelor's degree in Software Enginnering and am currently attending an online coding bootcamp called Bloc in the Full Stack Web Developer program. In this program, I've had experience with AngularJs, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby, Rails, HTML4/5, CSS, and Bootstrap.

                    I have had experience with working as a front-end developer at my job, which I've been at for 2.5 years; and through Bloc. However, I'm currently looking to pursue a job as a Web / Front-End Developer. Design and setting up pages with how they look and function is a strong passion of mine, and I would love to have the opportunity to further expand my knowledge of it by working in the field.

                    At the end of September, I plan on moving to Raleigh, North Carolina. I'm looking for a job around the area or remote. I'm available for a remote position right away or am available to start in the Raleigh area in the beginning of October.
